## Biography: I Have Not Always Been a Caveman

After trouble at work, and various illnesses (gout) I had a heart test called a catheterization. They use a thin flexible tube, inserted into your femoral artery to go up into your heart. Ultimately I had 90% blockage the main artery - the '[widow maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSPcuGjstN4)'. I was told heart surgery was 
my only option.


## I'm a software developer, not a writer.

Researching this book, I've run into multiple obstacles.

- white lies 
- propaganda - aka marketing
- govt lies
- outright lies

The landscape for finding truth has changed. Truth is a lie - and a lie is the truth.
Things are upside down.

I will try to distill what I've learned - and what I think I've learned. It is a journey  that I think anyone can benefit from. 

**Question everything.**

## The food pyramid ðŸ”Ž

Turn it upside down. No, I'm not kidding. The food pyramid was created by marketing agencies for large food corporations - with perverse incentives.

The promotion of low-fat diets and the rise of processed foods are indeed interconnected trends that emerged in the latter half of the 20th century, particularly in Western countries. Here's a brief overview:

1. Low-fat diet trend:
- Gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s
- Based on the hypothesis that dietary fat, especially saturated fat, was a major contributor to heart disease
- Led to widespread recommendations to reduce overall fat intake

2. Processed food industry response:
- Food manufacturers responded to the low-fat trend by creating numerous "low-fat" and "fat-free" products
- To maintain palatability, many of these products were often high in added sugars and refined carbohydrates
- This led to an increase in the availability and consumption of highly processed foods

3. Unintended consequences:
- While aiming to improve health, the low-fat trend may have inadvertently contributed to increased consumption of refined carbohydrates and added sugars
- Some researchers argue this shift may have played a role in the rise of obesity and type 2 diabetes rates


But the powers that be, who wrote the pyramid (and "The standard American Diet") are influenced (captured some may say) by big corps. 

Money is in the carbs - processed food - take flour, sugar and seed oils - box it up and put a tiger on it - they're great!

As a bonus, at the tail end, when you have diabetes from a lifetime of corn pops, you are in need of insulin. Win win for those with both stocks.

It is that simple. Perverse incentives. And a compliant (after many years of study, I'd say complicit) government.
