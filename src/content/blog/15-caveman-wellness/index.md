## Diet:

Emphasis on eating whole, unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and lean meats.
Avoidance of Processed Foods: Exclusion of processed foods, grains, dairy, and refined sugars, based on the idea that these were not part of the human diet during the Paleolithic era.
Natural Sources: Prioritizing food from natural sources, including grass-fed meats and organic produce.
Physical Activity:

## Natural Movement: 

Encouraging natural forms of exercise such as walking, running, climbing, and lifting, rather than structured gym workouts.
Functional Fitness: Focus on functional fitness that mimics the physical demands our ancestors faced, like lifting heavy objects and endurance activities.
Sunlight and Nature:

## Exposure to Sunlight: 

Regular exposure to sunlight for vitamin D synthesis and overall health.
Connection with Nature: Spending time outdoors to enhance mental and physical well-being.
Sleep:

## Natural Sleep Patterns: 

Promoting sleep patterns that align with the natural circadian rhythms, which can include going to bed early and waking up with the sun.
Quality Sleep Environment: Creating a sleep environment free from artificial lights and electronics.

## Stress Management:

Incorporating mindfulness practices and relaxation techniques that reduce stress and promote mental health.
Simplification: Simplifying life to reduce stress, akin to the less complex lifestyle of early humans.
Community and Social Connections:


## Less is More: 

Embracing a minimalist approach to life, focusing on the essentials and reducing clutter and excess.
By adopting these principles, proponents of caveman wellness believe that individuals can achieve a healthier, more balanced life, similar to what our ancestors experienced before the advent of modern civilization. This approach aims to align our lifestyle more closely with our evolutionary biology, potentially leading to improved physical health, mental well-being, and longevity.
