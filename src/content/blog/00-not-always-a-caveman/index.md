## Biography: I Have Not Always Been a Caveman


Believe it or not, I have not always been a caveman. In fact, my journey to this point began in the fluorescent-lit corridors of the tech industry, where I toiled away as a developer. My days were filled with lines of code, debugging sessions, and the ever-elusive quest for a bug-free program. It was a life that, on the surface, seemed worlds apart from the primal existence of our prehistoric ancestors.

Yet, despite the technological marvels and conveniences of modern life, I found myself increasingly drawn to the simplicity and rawness of the caveman's world. The more I delved into my work, the more I realized that the problems I faced as a developerâ€”stress, burnout, the constant race against timeâ€”were not unlike the challenges our ancestors faced. The difference was that their survival depended on outrunning predators and foraging for food, while mine hinged on meeting deadlines and squashing digital bugs.

The idea to write "Caveman's Guide to Surviving the Modern Industrial Landscape" came to me during a particularly grueling project. I was knee-deep in a sea of code, wrestling with a particularly stubborn glitch, when it struck me: despite all our advancements, we are still very much cavemen at heart, trying to navigate an increasingly complex and industrialized world. The tools had changed, but the struggle for survival remained.

I began to draw parallels between the two worlds. Just as the caveman had to adapt to his environment to survive, so too did we, the modern humans, have to adapt to the relentless pace of technological progress. The caveman had his wits, his strength, and his knowledge of the land; we had our skills, our ingenuity, and our ability to learn and innovate. Both required a keen understanding of one's surroundings and the ability to navigate challenges with resilience and creativity.

As a developer, I was well-versed in problem-solving, critical thinking, and the occasional bout of creative swearing. These skills, I realized, were not so different from those employed by our ancient forebears. And so, I decided to merge these two worlds into a guide that would help others not only survive but thrive in the modern industrial landscape.

Writing this book became my way of bridging the gap between the digital and the primal, offering insights and strategies that draw from both realms. Itâ€™s a blend of humor, practical advice, and a nod to the timeless wisdom of our ancestors. After all, if a caveman could survive saber-toothed tigers and ice ages, surely we can navigate office politics and tech upgrades with a little bit of their grit and ingenuity.

So here we are, dear reader, on this journey together. Whether you're a fellow developer, a professional in another field, or simply someone trying to make sense of the chaotic modern world, I hope this guide offers you a fresh perspective and a few laughs along the way. Remember, in the grand story of human survival, it's not just about the strongest or the smartest, but about those who can adapt, learn, and keep a sense of humor through it all. Welcome to the Caveman's Guide to Surviving the Modern Industrial Landscape.

## In fact, I am a regular, modern person like you

I'm a software developer by trade, not a writer.

Researching this book, I've run into multiple obstacles.

- lies
- propaganda
- govt lies
- outright lies

The landscape for finding truth has changed. Truth is a lie - and a lie is the truth.
Things are updside down.

I will try to distill what I've learned - and what I think I've learned. It is a journey  that I think anyone can benefit from. 

Question everything.

## The food pyramid ðŸ”Ž

Turn it upside down - and live happily ever after. No really.

Carbs, did you know, are the only macronutrient you don't _have to have_. 

But the powers that be, who wrote the pyramid, is influenced (captured some may say) by big corps. 

Money is in the carbs - processed food - flour, sugar, seed oils. As a bonus at the tail end, when you have diabetes from a 
lifetime of corn pops, you are in need of insulin. 

The best portfolios have 1) big food and 2) big pharma. It is that simple.
