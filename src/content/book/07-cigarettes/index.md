## No, Really!

You may have not noticed but big cigarette has taken over big food. 
Gone are the days when scientists carefully crafted the perfect, addictive cigarette - now they have moved on to
creating addicting processed food.


## Tobacco Companies' Influence on Food Industry

Tobacco giants like Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds [^1] invested heavily in the food industry between the 1980s and early 2000s, acquiring major food companies and brands[^2]. This move allowed them to apply their expertise in creating addictive products to the food sector.

## Development of Hyper-palatable Foods

Tobacco-owned food companies were found to produce a disproportionately high number of "hyper-palatable" foods[^2]. These foods are designed to be highly rewarding and potentially addictive, often containing specific combinations of fat, sugar, salt, and refined carbohydrates[^3].

## Key Findings

- Foods produced by tobacco-owned companies were 29% [^2] more likely to be classified as hyper-palatable due to fat and sodium content[^3].
- These foods were 80% more likely to be ultrahigh in carbohydrates and sodium compared to foods produced by non-tobacco-owned companies[^2].
- By 2018, over 57% of foods were classified as fat-and-sodium hyper-palatable, and over 17% as carbohydrate-and-sodium hyper-palatable, regardless of prior tobacco ownership[^3].

## Impact on Public Health

The proliferation of these hyper-palatable foods has had significant implications for public health:

- They now constitute about 68% of the American food supply[^3].
- These foods are associated with increased risk of obesity and related health problems[^2].
- The food industry has employed tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry, including emphasizing personal responsibility and lobbying against government regulation[^5].

## Current Situation

While tobacco companies largely divested from the food industry in the early 2000s,[^2] the impact of their involvement remains evident in the current food environment[^3]. The techniques and formulations developed during their ownership continue to influence the food industry and consumer eating habits.

This research highlights the need for increased awareness of the origins and design of processed foods, as well as potential policy interventions to address the prevalence of hyper-palatable foods in the interest of public health.
