## I Have Not Always Been a Caveman

After trouble at work, and various illnesses (gout) I had a heart test called a catheterization. They use a thin flexible tube that is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin - and up into your heart. Ultimately I had 90% blockage the main artery - the widow maker [^1]. I was told heart surgery was 
my only option.

I'm a veteran - and the surgery was done at the VA. The care I received was way beyond expectations. But there were some complications. The surgery lasted 8 hours instead of 4. A quad bypass was scheduled but only a triple was completed. I learned years later that I defibbed (died) on the table. Afterwards I had a few issues, like kidney disfunction. All in all, I'm grateful.

## I'm a software developer, not a writer.

Researching this book, I've run into multiple obstacles.

- white lies - things we were told that are just wrong
- propaganda - aka marketing
- government misrepresentations
- outright lies
- not being a writer ðŸ˜›

The landscape for finding truth has changed. Truth is a lie - and a lie is the truth. Things are upside down.

I will try to distill what I've learned - and what I think I've learned. It is a journey  that I think anyone can benefit from. 

## The food pyramid 

Turn it upside down. No, I'm not kidding. The food pyramid was created by marketing agencies for large food corporations - with perverse incentives. [^2]

The promotion of low-fat diets and the rise of processed foods are indeed interconnected trends that emerged in the latter half of the 20th century, particularly in Western countries. Here's a brief overview:

1. Low-fat diet trend:
- Gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s
- Based on the hypothesis that dietary fat, especially saturated fat, was a major contributor to heart disease
- Led to widespread recommendations to reduce overall fat intake

2. Processed food industry response:
- Food manufacturers responded to the low-fat trend by creating numerous "low-fat" and "fat-free" products
- To maintain palatability, many of these products were often high in added sugars and refined carbohydrates
- This led to an increase in the availability and consumption of highly processed foods

3. Unintended consequences:
- While aiming to improve health, the low-fat trend may have inadvertently contributed to increased consumption of refined carbohydrates and added sugars
- Some researchers argue this shift may have played a role in the rise of obesity and type 2 diabetes rates


But the powers that be, who wrote the pyramid (and "The standard American Diet") [^3] are influenced (captured some may say) by big corps. 

Money is in the carbs [^4] - processed food - take flour, sugar and seed oils - [^5] **box it up and put a tiger on it - they're great!**

As a bonus, at the tail end, when you have diabetes from a lifetime of corn pops, you are in need of insulin. Win win for those with both stocks.

It is that simple. Perverse incentives. And a compliant (after many years of study, I'd say complicit) government.
