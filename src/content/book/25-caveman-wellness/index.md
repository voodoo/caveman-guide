It may sound extravagant - having a sauna[^1] and a pool[^2] - but it does not have to be. For (much) less than $500 you can have both. 

In the early afternoon I do the sauna and then jump in the pool. 

When in the sauna, I practice deep, slow, mindful breathing - and I SWEAT.

For an ice bath I put a kiddy pool into the big kiddy pool and put a bag of ice in it. 
No, you are not immersed but you will get cold. $5 plus the ice.

There are those who would question the benefit of such a routine. The science-y-types always ask "how do you know it works". I don't. I do know that sweating and plunging in the pool is ancestrally appropriate - something we used to do a lot more. 

In the end, it does not matter. I ENJOY it. It breaks up my day and gives me some time to think on my own.


## Sauna, pool and ice baths

The practice of alternating between a hot sauna and a cold pool plunge, sometimes called contrast therapy, has gained popularity for its potential health benefits. Here's an overview of the potential advantages:

1. Improved circulation:
- The heat from the sauna dilates blood vessels
- The cold plunge causes them to constrict
- This alternation can promote better blood flow throughout the body

2. Muscle recovery:
- May help reduce muscle soreness after exercise
- Can potentially speed up recovery time for athletes

3. Stress reduction:
- The temperature changes can trigger the release of endorphins
- Many people find the practice relaxing and invigorating

4. Immune system boost:
- Some studies suggest it may stimulate the immune system
- Potentially increases production of white blood cells

5. Detoxification:
- Sweating in the sauna can help eliminate toxins through the skin
- The cold plunge may help flush toxins from tissues

6. Cardiovascular health:
- The contrast in temperatures can provide a workout for your heart
- May improve heart rate variability

7. Improved sleep:
- The relaxation and temperature changes may promote better sleep quality

8. Mental clarity:
- Many users report feeling more alert and focused after the treatment

9. Skin health:
- Sweating can help clear pores
- Cold water can tighten skin and may improve its appearance

10. Pain relief:
- May help alleviate chronic pain for some individuals
- Could potentially reduce inflammation in the body

## Breathing

Breathing is a fundamental physiological process that, when done mindfully, can have significant positive impacts on health. Here's an overview of how breathing techniques can contribute to overall well-being:

1. Stress reduction:
- Deep, slow breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system
- This can lower heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol levels

2. Improved lung function:
- Proper breathing exercises can increase lung capacity
- May help in managing conditions like asthma or COPD

3. Better sleep:
- Calming breathing techniques can help prepare the body for sleep
- May reduce insomnia and improve sleep quality

4. Enhanced focus and cognitive function:
- Controlled breathing can increase oxygen supply to the brain
- This may improve concentration and mental clarity

5. Pain management:
- Certain breathing techniques can help alleviate chronic pain
- Often used in conjunction with meditation or mindfulness practices

6. Digestive health:
- Deep breathing can stimulate the vagus nerve, which aids digestion
- May help reduce symptoms of digestive disorders

7. Improved posture:
- Proper breathing engages core muscles
- Can lead to better spinal alignment and reduced back pain

8. Boosted immune system:
- Some studies suggest that controlled breathing may enhance immune function
- Potentially linked to reduced inflammation in the body

9. Emotional regulation:
- Breathing exercises can help manage anxiety and depression
- Often used in cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness practices

10. Cardiovascular health:
- Regular breathing exercises may improve heart rate variability
- Could potentially lower risk of cardiovascular diseases

Some popular breathing techniques include:
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Box breathing (4-4-4-4 pattern)
- Alternate nostril breathing
- 4-7-8 technique

## Get some sun

Getting some sun can have several benefits for your health and well-being:

1. Vitamin D production: Sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in your skin, which is crucial for bone health, immune function, and mood regulation.

2. Improved mood: Sunlight exposure can boost serotonin levels, potentially alleviating symptoms of mild depression and seasonal affective disorder.

3. Better sleep: Regular sun exposure, especially in the morning, can help regulate your circadian rhythm, leading to improved sleep quality.

4. Enhanced cognitive function: Some studies suggest that sunlight may improve cognitive performance and alertness.

5. Lowered blood pressure: Moderate sun exposure may help lower blood pressure by increasing nitric oxide levels in the skin.

6. Potential reduction in certain health risks: Some research indicates that regular, moderate sun exposure might be associated with reduced risks of certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular issues.

## Time restricted eating

I don't know about you, but when I tried intermittent fasting, I found I could not sleep. That first night, my body was telling me to eat something. All night long - and I did not sleep. 

Time restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting that focuses on limiting the daily eating window. It is something I can do. Forever.

Here's a concise overview:

1. Concept: Consume all daily calories within a specific time frame, typically 8-12 hours. 4 is better.

2. Fasting period: The remaining 16-20 hours are spent fasting.

3. Potential benefits:
   - Improved metabolic health
   - Better blood sugar control
   - Weight management
   - Enhanced cellular repair processes

4. Flexibility: Can be adjusted to fit different lifestyles and schedules.

5. Common approaches: 20/4 (20 hours fasting, 4 hours eating).

6. Ease of adoption: Often considered more sustainable than other fasting methods.

## Sleep

Sleep is crucial for overall health and well-being. Here's a brief overview of its importance:

1. Physical restoration: Sleep allows the body to repair tissues, synthesize proteins, and release growth hormone.

2. Cognitive function: Proper sleep enhances memory consolidation, learning, and problem-solving abilities.

3. Emotional regulation: Adequate sleep helps maintain emotional stability and reduces the risk of mood disorders.

4. Immune support: Sleep strengthens the immune system, helping to fight off infections and diseases.

5. Metabolic health: Good sleep patterns contribute to better appetite regulation and insulin sensitivity.

6. Cardiovascular health: Consistent, quality sleep is associated with lower risks of heart disease and stroke.

7. Longevity: Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to shorter lifespans and increased mortality risk.

8. Performance: Sleep improves physical and mental performance in daily activities and sports.

9. Stress reduction: Adequate sleep helps manage stress levels and cortisol production.
